  Hey there! Welcome to my blog! I use this as a place to share some of the interesting insights that I found during recent projects and share other tidbits that I feel may be useful to fellow data scientists. Please peruse and enjoy!

### How I got here  
I moved out to San Francisco in 2017 to work at a FinTech startup. I've had a few different roles over the past several years and always enjoyed the work that I was doing but realized that there were hard limits to what I could offer in most of the operations roles I'd found myself in. It was only after moving to San Francisco and seeing so many diverse backgrounds that I started to believe I could fill more technical roles like that of a data scientist.  

Before joining the business world, I majored in Classical French Horn Performance at the Manhattan School of Music in NYC where I studied with members of the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera.  

### Random

On weekends you can find me playing 2v2 volleyball... Feel free to say hi if you see me!

Some other fun facts:

* Always down to watch a good B-grade Sci-Fi show (I wish they never canceled [Dark Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Matter_(TV_series))!)
* Still occasionally play orchestra concerts, most recently with Mozart to Mendelssohn, part of [SF Civic Music](https://www.sfcivicmusic.org/)
* Recently started snowboarding and am thinking of starting surfing (I know, I'm really embracing the California lifestyle)
* I love when someone proves me wrong about something!
